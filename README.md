an inofficial app for the student sports in Hamburg

## about
HsHH is an inofficial app for student sports in Hamburg. It allows you to
  browse the current sports offers and sign up for them. The app is not
  affiliated with the university or the sports department.
  The app is open source and free to use. It does not track you or show ads.

## download
- Android
    - **[my website](https://apps.robbb.in/HsHH)**
    - the Github *Releases* Page
    - Play Store: 
        1. join the [internal testers group](https://groups.google.com/g/peertest-org)
        2. download the app [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.robin.hshh)
- iOS
    - putting the app in the App Store costs about 100€/Year. This is a little pricy for me. Because of this, you can only install the app on iOS by *building* it yourself

> **NOTE:**<br>
> to install the app, you must first [allow unknown sources](https://www.droidwiki.org/wiki/Sideloading)
